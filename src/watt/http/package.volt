 * Provides a simple interface for making HTTP requests.  
 * `HttpInterface` and `RequestInterface` are implemented with classes
 * with the names `Http` and `Request`, respectively. This is to allow
 * an different implementation for each platform.
 * ### Example
 * ```volt
 * import watt.http;
 * ...
 * http := new Http();
 * req  := new Request(http);
 * req.server = "www.example.com";
 * req.port = 80;
 * while (!http.isEmpty()) http.perform();
 * result := req.toString();
 * ```
