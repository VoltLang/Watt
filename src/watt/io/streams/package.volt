 * Define stream interfaces for input and output.
 *
 * A stream is an interface that reads or
 * writes to a destination, one character at a time.
 *
 * Watt ships with implementations of `OutputFileStream` and `InputFileStream`
 * appropriate for the current platform.
 *
 * However, the intent is that you program to the vanilla `OutputStream` and
 * `InputStream` classes where possible, and then the implementation is not
 * important. For example:
 *
 * ```volt
 * fn outputAnImportantThing(os: OutputStream)
 * ...
 * outputAnImportantThing(output);
 * outputAnImportantThing(new OutputFileStream("foo.txt"));
 * ```
